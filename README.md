# My-Leetcode-Solutions
You can find my solutions to leetcode problems here.
For any perticular question if you see in the history of commits you can see the less efficient approch to that same problem.
Not all the solutions are my own ideas. Some I've looked from github, gfg, leetcode discuss.
The less efficeint solutions would be my ofcourse xD.
